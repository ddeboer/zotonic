Zotonic installation
======================

You will need to:

1. Install Erlang 13B or newer. Build it from source, or
   use packages (see platform-specific notes below)

2. Install ImageMagick (version 6.5 or higher) for the 'convert' and
   'identify' tools (also install libjpeg, -tiff, -png and other
   required libraries).  Make sure that the convert and identify tools
   are in your path so that zotonic can find them. For auto-rotation
   to work you'll need the "exif" utility as well.

3. Install PostgreSQL (preferably 8.3 or newer).

4. Obtain a copy of the Zotonic source code.




Steps to install Zotonic
------------------------

Make sure you put the zotonic source in a directory named 'zotonic'
(important for now; we're working on a solution for this).

1. Type "make" in the root of zotonic (there where the Makefile is located). (*1)

2. Create an user and database in PostgreSQL:

CREATE USER zotonic WITH PASSWORD 'yourdbpassword';
CREATE DATABASE zotonic WITH OWNER = zotonic ENCODING = 'UTF8';
GRANT ALL ON DATABASE zotonic TO zotonic;
\c zotonic
CREATE LANGUAGE "plpgsql";

4. Create the configuration for the default site by copying
   priv/sites/default/config.in to priv/sites/default/config

5. Edit this file; at least specify the credentials to the postgres database.

5. Make sure that the directory "priv/sites/default" and all its subdirectories are readable 
   and writeable for the current user. (Which is the user zotonic will run under.)

6. Start zotonic in debug mode:

  ./start.sh

7. You see zotonic starting up, lots of messages pass by, and zotonic will install the initial database.
   When something goes wrong here, then it is almost always a problem with the database connection. Check your 
   database configuration in the zotonic.sh file.

8. Point your browser to 
	
    http://localhost:8000/
	
   or logon as user 'admin' (the default password is empty) at: 

    http://localhost:8000/admin/

   You will be asked to change the admin password before you can proceed into the admin.

9. When all done, then you can stop the erlang shell with:

    q().
  



Operating system specific notes:
-------------------------------

FreeBSD:
-------
If you're running on FreeBSD, make sure you've got the 'GNU' 'make'
(check with 'make --version', which should give you GNU, and version
info) If you're not running GNU-make as a default, edit the Makefile
to run with 'gmake' (make sure gmake is available first))



Ubuntu 9.04 (jaunty)
--------------------

You'll need to build erlang from source. Before building, make sure
you install these packages:

sudo apt-get install build-essential unixodbc-dev libncurses-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev libexpat1-dev

PostgreSQL and Imagemagick are available on Ubuntu as packages:

sudo apt-get install postgresql-8.4 imagemagick


Ubuntu 9.10 (karmic)
--------------------
Follow the instructions for Ubuntu 9.04, but instead of compiling
erlang, you can just install Erlang but you need the ssl and xml dev
libraries as well for XMPP:

sudo apt-get install erlang build-essential libxml2-dev libexpat1-dev


Debian (lenny)
--------------------
You'll need to build erlang from source. Before building, make sure
you install these packages:

sudo apt-get install build-essential libncurses5-dev m4
sudo apt-get install openssl libssl-dev
sudo apt-get install unixodbc-dev


Windows
-------
Currently, Zotonic has not been tested on the Windows
platform. However, the main dependencies Erlang, PostgreSQL and
ImageMagick do work on Windows, so, if you're adventurous, it should
be possible to get it running.

For a start, you'll have to compile Zotonic and make a Windows version
of start.sh, probably as a .bat file.... We'd love to hear your
progress! Post a message to zotonic-developers@googlegroups.com to
inform us of your progress.
