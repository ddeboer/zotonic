** A new default site
   The default site of a vanilla Zotonic install is now modelled after
   a simple blog-style website, complete with an archive section,
   keywords, navigation to previous and next posts, atom feeds and comments.

** Speed improvements
   The Webmachine code was restructured to be more lean-and-mean,
   yielding up to 20% more performance on page requests.

** WebSockets support
   When WebSockets is available in the browser, then it is used as a
   replacement for the Comet long poll. Currently only Google Chrome
   supports this feature but it is expected to arrive in other
   browsers soon.

** Admin updates
   Support for editing a location (Google map picker), a new
   collection type "query" was added for creating "saved searches".

** EUnit support
   A start has been made to put the core functionality of Zotonic in

   on increasing the code coverage of the tests.
